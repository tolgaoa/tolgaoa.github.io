Existing registration, discovery, and authorization mechanisms in the 5G core control plane present scalability and efficiency challenges. As cellular deployments scale to accommodate diverse user demands, the 5G core control plane suffers from increased inter-Virtual Network Function (VNF) communication latency, thus deteriorating the reliability of critical procedures. To address this problem, we propose 5G-STREAM (Service mesh Tailored for Reliable, Efficient, and Authorized Microservices) to optimize control plane traffic in distributed cloud environments by establishing a topology awareness of service chains across cloud hierarchies. Leveraging this awareness, 5G-STREAM dynamically configures communication pathways to reduce discovery and authorization signaling overhead, thus increasing the reliability of inter-VNF communication. We develop a prototype of 5G-STREAM and evaluate its performance. Our evaluation results show that 5G-STREAM significantly reduces the process completion time in core service chains by up to 2x inter VNF-Network Repository Function (NRF) latency per transaction, with more pronounced benefits in larger service chains. Furthermore, we show that the cost required to deploy 5G-STREAM is an additional 0.1 USD/hr on AWS for a VNF handling a sustained rate of 50,000 requests/minute.
