I am a Ph.D. candidate at [Bradley Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Virginia Tech](https://ece.vt.edu/) supervised by Professor [Angelos Stavrou](https://ece.vt.edu/people/profile/angelos.html) and Professor [Haining Wang](https://ece.vt.edu/people/profile/hnw.html) in the Network and Software Security Lab (NSSL). My research interests are 5G core networks, O-RAN, cloud computing and system security.

My research primarily focuses on identifying scalability limitations and security vulnerabilities in 5G and beyond networks. To address these shortcomings, I strive to design, deploy, and evaluate novel solutions that aim to enhance the scalability, security, and efficiency of upcoming mobile network generations.

Before joining Virginia Tech, I received by M.Sc. from [Danmarks Tekniske Universitet](https://www.dtu.dk/english/) in Telecommunications (2018) and B.Sc. from [Bilkent University](https://ee.bilkent.edu.tr/en/) in Electrical and Electronics Engineering (2016).
