I am a Ph.D. candidate at [Bradley Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Virginia Tech](https://ece.vt.edu/) supervised by Professor [Angelos Stavrou](https://ece.vt.edu/people/profile/angelos.html) and Professor [Haining Wang](https://ece.vt.edu/people/profile/hnw.html) in the Network and Software Security Lab (NSSL). My research interests are 5G core networks, O-RAN, cloud computing and system security.

My research revolves around identifying scalability bottlenecks and security issues in 5G networks. I strive to design, implement and test novel frameworks that will facilitate the scalable, secure and efficient delivery of 5G and beyond networks.

Before joining Virginia Tech, I received by M.Sc. from [Danmarks Tekniske Universitet](https://www.dtu.dk/english/) in Telecommunications (2018) and B.Sc. from [Bilkent University](https://ee.bilkent.edu.tr/en/) in Electrical and Electronic Engineering (2016).
