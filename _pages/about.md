I received my PhD from the [Bradley Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Virginia Tech](https://ece.vt.edu/) supervised by Professor [Angelos Stavrou](https://www.vt.edu/innovationcampus/about/faculty/stavrou-angelos.html) and Professor [Haining Wang](https://ece.vt.edu/people/profile/wangh.html) in the [Network and Software Security Lab (NSSL)](https://nss.ece.vt.edu/), where my research primarily focused on 5G core networks, O-RAN, cloud computing and system security.

Currently, I still work on identifying scalability limitations and security vulnerabilities in 5G and beyond networks. To address these shortcomings, I strive to design, deploy, and evaluate novel solutions that aim to enhance the scalability, security, and efficiency of upcoming mobile network generations with novel architectures.
